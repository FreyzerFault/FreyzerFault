### Currently working on some projects for University

Learning low level Graphics Programming with OpenGL 4.x with my projects:
- igvCraft is a Minecraft prototype in old OpenGL for Graphic and Visual Informatics subject
- Prototype Defense is a Tower Defence prototype working on a selfmade recent OpenGL Framework, designed with scalating purposes for future projects, like a Tower Defence Engine, or another low level made game. (work in progress)
